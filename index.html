    <h1> 🥐 Croissant</h1>
  <br />
  <p class="intro"> A croissant is a buttery, flaky, 
    Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
    Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. 
    The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. </p>
